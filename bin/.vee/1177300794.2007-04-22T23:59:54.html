House Article

This  is what I transcribed form the hard to read copy of the ar-
ticle I was given.  I am going to be getting in  touch  with  the
original  owner's  son  soon  ( I hope ) to get the skinny on the
more history...sorry for any typos - I did this pretty fast.

IBERVILLE POSTMASTER REFLECTS

This week, the postal service may officially finalize closing the
Iberville  Post  Office and change the Zip Code of Residents from
70746 to 70776, according to postal officials in Baton Rouge.

Residents will receive mail from St. Gabriel, as they do now, ad-
dressed to Iberville.

Actually  the  post  office in the villiage of Iberville closed a
year ago, when the postmaster, Mrs.  Louis  G.  Hoffman  retired.
Her memories continue to remain.

"When  I first came out here," she said, "it was a little strange
to me, to be living in the country.  i was born  and  raised  two
blocks  from Third Street, and I never thought I would ever leave
Baton Rouge to go to the country.  But the odd  part  about  that
is,  that I have two sisters and one brother, and all of us, when
we left Baton Rouge, we went to live in the country.   My  olders
sister  went  to  Hawaii.   She  lived there for forty-two years.
She's back in Louisiana now."

It was an abrupt awakening to become a postal employee.  When she
got  married,  her  hustband had been running the post office but
now had begun to teach.

When I got married, and we were on honeymoon for two  weeks,  she
says, they came home-came here (to their house in Iberville), and
"I said, said, 'Well, what I am gonna do?' and  he  said,  "Well,
you're  gonna  work in the post office, and the store. Surprise'"
"I said, 'Well, I have never sold anything before'".

Later, Mr. Hoffman was to become principle of St. Gabriel  School
and then Super-intendent of Schools for Iberville Parish.  He re-
tired a number of years ago. And she got her first lesson on  the
job.   She had been a nurse, had graduated from nursing school at
the Lady of the Lake Medical Center, and  now  she  was  the  new
postmaster.

It  was  really different to come out here and sell five yards of
material or a pair of [past-margin] (shoes?), or a pound of  lard
or a pound of [past-margin], or a pind of rice.  Sometimes it (?)
a nicle of rice, or a nickle of beans because that  is  all  they
had to spend for the day, she remembers.

She  became  the Postmaster in 1951, and retired on October 31 of
last year.  [off-margin] her was Joe Burns,  who  had  asked  the
post office to be established, since the residents of Manchac had
to walk all the way to St. Gabriel to get their mail.  Then  came
[off-margin]  Hadell,  and  the thrid postmaster was her husband.
But the mail service was the only  thing  located  in  the  small
building her husband had build next to the house.

We had a general merchandise stor, and we had the only telephone,
she says.  People would come day or night to use the phone.  They
would  come  to  the Post Office for their mail.  I used to write
their letters, read their letters to them, and make  their  money
orders - they used Sears & Roebuck quite a bit.

"One  of the most interesting things, when I first came out here,
was to ship hides, furs.  They'd bring them to the  post  office,
and I'd put them in sacks to package them and mail to them to St.
Louis."

"Before I came out here they used to sell moss.  Moss was the big
product  years ago.  They used to sell moss to Mr. Hoffman.  He'd
ship it."

Highway 30, or known as Nicholson Drive in Baton Rouge,  provides
access  for  Ibervill residents today. At one time, though, there
was only a gravel road and residents had to go down the  road  to
the river road to take the seventeen mile stretch to Baton Rouge.
So mail was not carried by truck.

"We had to go to the railroad track," she says, "and  they  would
throw  our  mail off in pouches. For them to get our mail, we had
an iron arm that we would attach the pouch  to,  and  they  would
grab it (from the train) as they passed."

"One day , we had a man that lived on the place that usually took
the mail, and after he had attached the mail pouch to this crane,
a  train  passed,  loaded  with  .... [the rest is cut off of the
page];

Caption under picture of front of house: "The Hoffman's home, lo-
cated  next  to  the Iberville, La. Post Office, was built by Mr.
Louis G. Hoffman many years ago our of cypress walls, and some of
the floor was built out of pecan.
