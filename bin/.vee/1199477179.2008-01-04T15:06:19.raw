books

--

Among the many wonderful gifts I received this Christmas, I wanted to highlight a few books that I find very good for those interested in computer science:

Concise Encyclopedia of Computer Science 

ISBN: 0333998685


The New Turing Omnibus: Sixty-Six Excursions in Computer Science

ISBN: 0805071660


The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable

ISBN: 1400063515


Once I go through each thoroughly, I may post some sort of review.
