Another small step for Unix

--

How Google got some of the legends behind Unix, C, Plan 9, Aleph, and Limbo to
come work for them and create Go, I have no idea.

What is clear to me is that Google has an investment in not only these 
people, but also Unix - but more to the point, Plan 9.  

Plan 9 was ported to IBM's BlueGene super computers a while ago; but 
now the small step forward - Go is being ported to BG's PPC architecture.

I am not suggesting that Google is going to use the BG to mine your gmail
accounts, but this to me is yet another act of Google inserting itself 
into computing history - right after Bell Labs.

Go will never replace MPI/OpenMP/CAF/Fortran/C for these kind of machines,
but you never know. It might be used in product where other HPCS 
languages (Chapel, Fortress, X10) have failed to move beyond the toy 
stage.

In otherwords, I think this is a very, very big deal.
