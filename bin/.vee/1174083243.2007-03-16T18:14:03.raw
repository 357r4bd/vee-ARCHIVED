[vee] batch example (repost)

--

I decided to keep just the one vee-log.  For vee stuff, I am going to use the "[vee]" tag at the beginning.  This is a repost of the vee in batch mode example.

---

I  have  a cronjob running a pretty meaningless clamav scan every
10 minutes.  The command part of the crontab entry looks like:

clamscan -r -i --move=./infected | vee  -b  -I   -d  ./clamav  -t
"clamav scan of archive files"

You can see the vee-log live in action at:

Here

Please report any problems that you might be experiencing.

One  thing  is  for  sure, it would be nice for vee to reformat a
particular message all by its lonesome.  Hmmmm.....

Cheers.
