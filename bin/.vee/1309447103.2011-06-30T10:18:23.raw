[vee] mention on 'One thing well' blog

--

I was looking at my site's stats and noticed a spike in early June. After some more investigation, I found out that 
it was as a result of vee being highlighted for the day on this pretty neat blog that highlights simple, useful
software. Unfortunately, they don't use vee - not that they would.  Curiously, they called it a SSG or "static site generator".
I've been wanting to work on vee a lot lately, but am not interested in bloating it - just improving internals so that it does its
"one thing" even better.

Here's the link to the original post:
