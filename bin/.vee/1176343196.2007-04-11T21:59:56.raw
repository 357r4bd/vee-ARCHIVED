[vee] version 0.9.9-alpha

--

I fixed things so that the top and bottom templates work for all types of formatting available in the default code.  In fact, as a result, it is a lot easier to add new formatting.  I might be a lot more willing to add things now.

I am pretty much freezing things in order to test for the 1.0 release.
