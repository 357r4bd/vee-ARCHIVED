update on 2,3 turing machine

--

This all happened at the end of October, but I am just getting around to checking out the results - and the fallout of the proposed solution.

I first posted about the challenge in:

On October 24, 2007 it was announced that someone had shown the 2,3 TM to be universal. Links to the announcement and "proof" follow:

However, a few days later there was a dispute with the proof.  I am not sure of the current situation, but it doesn't seem to be resolved as of yet.  On one hand, there is a computer scientist making a theoretical argument then on the other there is Wolfram, et al. thumbing their noses at the guy.  I guess we'll see when and if the proof ever gets peer reviewed.

In the meantime, as good of a place as any to follow the saga is Wikipedia:

As a side note, the person refuting the proof is Vaughan Pratt, who seems pretty well qualified to do so:
