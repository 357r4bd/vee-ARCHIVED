Perl-FLAT Update

--

Most of my current activities have been related to getting the fash utility into a useful state.  Currently, it is a shell script that simply provides a simplified interface to the obtuse, "perl -MFLAT -e xx", idiom that I've forced upon myself.

As a result, I also moved all the command line interface stuff out of the base FLAT.pm file.  The file currently implementing all command line functions is FLAT/CMD.pm, but I may further subdivide based on functionality.

I've been trying to work out how how to reduce a DFA into a regular expression using state elimination, and I feel like I am pretty close.  HMU outlines a method, but I am too dense to really understand what they are doing - but I have a feeling that what I've come up with is pretty close.

In addition to inplementing a function that will get an equivalent regular expression out of a DFA, I am also looking at implementing a feature that will allow the pumping of valid strings in DFAs that include closures.  Currently, all strings are created by tracing all acyclic paths from the start state to any of the accepting states.  This approach gets all strings from a DFA with no cycles, but totally misses the mark for more interesting DFAs - like the ones that result from the shuffle of closed strings.  The algorithm is one I designed, and is based on the traditional depth first search of a directed graph.  It is sure not to be new, but some of the things I've come up with are pretty darn interesting to me. 

In any case, I hope to have both the DFA->RE feature and the advanced string pump completed by the end of this semester.  Included will be full descriptions of the algorthms that I end up implementing.

Lastly, I am taking a theory class this semester - which I believe will motivate me to increase the set of features. Stay tuned!
