LiveCDs, nanoblogger

Live CDs

After getting an emergency call from a good friend of mine to help him rescue some data off of an old Toshiba laptop running some strain of Windows, I suggested that he use a "live cd" with linux and various tools on it.  I realized that my inventory of live cds were a bit dated, so all I could suggest to him was Ubuntu or Knoppix.  Well, Ubuntu seems to be a bit heavy for the fragile laptop, so now were are on our way to trying Knoppix.  If that doesn't work, we're going to check out the "gparted" live cd that I stumbled upon.  It uses fluxbox and has a partition manager and other neat tools.  It is also only 50mb.  The only requirements that it needs for us is that it a) can mount usb mass storage devices and can read NTFS. 

Everyone knows where to get Ubuntu and Knoppix, but Parted is at:

I also created a live cd of the latest DragonFlyBSD.  I think that I need to get off of my butt and create a rescue thumbdrive containing gparted + other tools.  FreeBSD has a couple of related projects that aim to help you generate your own live cd - so maybe I could do that, too.

Lastly, as I wrap up this blurb about live cds, I just found this list:

Nanoblogger

I just found out about this thing called nanoblogger:

It looks neat and nice and pretty, etc, but I look at it as an example of what I don't want vee to become.  Now more than ever I am aware of how more options and functionality make software exponential complex for a diminishing set of returns.  For example, trying to manage categories and different types of content is hard with out using a RDBMS *if* you care about consistency.  

There has been quite a discussion over at bsdnexus.org's forum regarding options and ideas. Admittedly, I started the thread, so I am happy to see it taking on some momentum.

They've been particular helpful in making suggestions that fit well with my goals, yet make the user experience that much nicer.

Cheers.
