Another "computing machine"

--

I find mechanical devices that "compute" things to be very interesting.  As I learn more about the theory of computation and how computers "work," I can appreciate what these machines do on a higher level.  In otherwords, it is becoming clear to me how all of those circuit elements and 0/1s are not doing anything that can't be accomplished by mechanical devices.

Now, this latest machine that I've read about is not a universal machine.  It has a special purpose.  It also doesn't compute actual number, but it instead simulates the basic workings of a very complex system. These sorts of things are done in software all of the time.  People use such programs to model such complex systems as (modern) economies, black hole collisions, weather, etc.

This machine was used a long time ago to help people understand and develop an intuition for the workings of the British economy.  It is is all mechanical, but is no less sophisticated in purpose than computer models that are run on digital computers today.

Without further ado, there's the link:
