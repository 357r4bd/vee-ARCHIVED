vii renamed to vee

--

Incredibly, this little project has been noticed for inclusing in FreeBSD ports.  The only caveat is that it be renamed as not to conflict with another project called "vii".  I was more than happy to oblige.

The new name is "vee", and I have requested a project page at SourceForge as well.

The current version has not changed in functionality or version number.  It is not critical at this time to upgrade, but the current and all future versions of the tool with will use "vee" in place of "vii" everywhere.

I do not have a script to convert everything for you, but in a nutshell, here is what you have to do if you want to use the code with the new name:

FIRST, make a back up of your ~/.vii directory!! Don't blame me if you nuke your stuff. Then,

1) (did you back up ~/.vii?) ... okay, then:  download the new script

2) change any file that has "vii" in it to be "vee", especially:
REQUIRED:
  ~/.vii           ->  ~/.vee
  ~/.viirc         ->  ~/.veerc 
OPTION (if you want to use them):
  ~/vii-top.tpl    -> ~/vee-top.tpl
  ~/vii-bottom.tpl -> ~/vee-bottom.tpl

3) you may want to reformat all messages, but this is your call; be sure to note any potential issues before doing a wholesale change like this.

If any serious issues arrise, I will post the details including fixes ASAP.

Cheers.
