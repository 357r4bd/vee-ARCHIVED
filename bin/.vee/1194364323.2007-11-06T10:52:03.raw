finally got 0x743.com unlocked

--

My domain, 0x743.com, has been locked out by my fascist registrar (joker.com) over a UDRP dispute for over 2 weeks now because I didn't have accurate data in my WHOIS registration.  Nevermind that WHOIS data by law doesn't have to be valid and forget the fact that I like to be somewhat discrete about my personal information. They can kiss my ass.  

Joker.com put my domain name on hold, and in the end it required a fee of $25 per domain to get things unlocked.  Yeah, it included another year of registration, but it is still very shitty what they did.

I understand they might be following the ICANN rules, but I don't really give a fuck.  When accurate WHOIS data is dictated by US Law, then I /might/ consider following it.  But having a pseudo governmental monopolistic entity like ICANN putting the screws to me get me madder than hell. 

Anyway, the domain is back and I an $50 poorer (I had another domain name recovered) thanks to those fuckwads and their retarded rules.

From now on, any domains I buy will not be from Joker because they don't have the balls to stand up to ICANN.
