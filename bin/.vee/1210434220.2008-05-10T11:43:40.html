the end of the semester has arrived

--

The  end  of Spring 2008 has finally arrived for me.  I learned a
lot - both good and bad.

First the good.  I learned a lot about graph theory,  and  I  can
say  that  I  enjoyed the class thoroughly.  I learned more about
how to write proofs and that I am very interested in certain dis-
crete  mathematical  topics.  In Fall I am taking a combinatorics
class,  and I hope to eventually take an abstract  algebra  class
or two.

This  summer, I am taking a selected reading class with a profes-
sion whom I wish to have as my advisor.  More on this in a future
post.

Now the bad (beware, rant).

While  I  learned  a  lot  in "programming languages," it was not
enough to offset the horrible experience a terrible  teacher  can
give  someone  who is there to learn.  I started off the semester
looking forward to learning all about advanced  programming  lan-
guage  design.   This includes stuff like axiomatic, operational,
and denotational semantics.  I did learn what they all were,  but
at a hefty emotional price.

I  suppose  one  could blame the department for pulling in an PhD
with ZERO teaching experience or personality, but at  some  point
the  teacher  themself is to blame for providing the student with
an ineffective learning environment.  The person that  tradition-
ally  teaches  this class was unavailable for some reason, but he
is consistently rated as one of the best teachers in the  depart-
ment.  Unfortunately, the best got replaced with the worst.

I  don't know if I would have dropped the class knowing then what
I know now, but it chaps my ass royally that I had to be part  of
the  class  where  a  crappy  newbie  teacher  used   us  to test
crazy/stupid teaching methods. Oh, and did  I  mention  that  the
teacher  knew absolute shit about the subject?  When one asks in-
formed questions on the material being presented, they should ex-
pect  the  teacher should know enough to provide even a basic an-
swer.  No.  You'd also expect them to at least know the  material
on  the  slides (that they jacked) well enough to effectively ex-
plain it and answer basic clarifying questions about it. No.

In summary, I believe that I, amongst others, got totally fucked.
We  were  failed  by both the department and by the teacher.  You
can bet your ass that I am going to avoid this topic from now on,
and this is a real shame because in the beginning I was interest-
ed in giving it a chance.
