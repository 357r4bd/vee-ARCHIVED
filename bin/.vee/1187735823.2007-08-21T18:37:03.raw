Sun to start using transactional memory

--

I try not to just post links, but I found this story on the Register significant.

Sun is going to be including transactional memory into some lines of machines, and this a key step towards making the writing of concurrent applications "easier" for us humans. In addition to making it easier by allowing programmers to be a little more careless with ensuring that their parallel lines of execution are doing the correct thing, it also seems to me like a key to dealing with the cache coherency issue that I see arising once we start seeing many (as in more than 8) cores per CPU die. 

Here is the wikipedia page on transactional memory:

The use of transactional memory was mentioned in the paper (which is worth a read),
