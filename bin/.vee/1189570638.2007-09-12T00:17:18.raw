[vee] Testing a new feature ... filters

--

I  am testing a new feature that should dramatically increase the
functionality of vee.

This new feature is a custom filter that is applied right  before
formatting is applied.

The following image has been inserted where a simple keyword once
appeared.  The sample filter is basic, and I have  no  intentions
of  creating anything beyond that.  Once I realease this it is my
hope that users will create useful filters.

I will be developing a "standard," but the main requirement  will
be that it was accept the raw text of the post via STDIN and out-
put the modified "raw" text via STDOUT.

More later...oh, and here is that image:

Cheers....

PS: I have not committed it to SVN yet, but once I do I will increment minor version and will get around to creating tags at the various release points; this will allow me to have a "bleed edge".
