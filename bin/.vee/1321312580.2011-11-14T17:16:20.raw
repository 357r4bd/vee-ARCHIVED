Other Unix tools...

--

I started thinking the other day that there might be a good way to analyze all of the fundamental Unix tools out there that to find
holes in this matrix (of sorts) where no tool exists, but should.

I was pointed to this page today, and it looks pretty neat. Some of the utils deal with more complex command linking, most notably
"pee". It's like "tee", but for deviating to another process rather than output STDOUT to a file.

I was further excited this weekend by learning of the parallel gzip utility that provides a gzip workalike, but actually takes
advantage of manycore machines. It's called "pigz". Another great name.

I've been very interested in learning more about Unix's deep rooted and practical philosophies; and it might be just enough motivate
to attempt to write my own fundamental Unix tools that do one thing, do it well, and work play well with others.

This also motivates me a little to think of how I can make vee more of a utility and not just for blagging over the commandline.
