All human languages are Turing Complete

--

I read something recently in a 2007 article by Larry Wall. It made my jaw drop because he was right.  He says:

<i>
Perl is a postmodern language, and a lot of conservative folks feel like Postmodernism is a rather liberal notion. So it's rather ironic that my views on Postmodernism were primarily informed by studying linguistics and translation as taught by missionaries, specifically, the Wycliffe Bible Translators. One of the things they hammered home is that there's really no such thing as a primitive human language. By which they mean essentially that all human languages are Turing complete.
</i>

I am sorry, but - wow. Why, "wow"? Because I never thought of it this way. This certainly complements and augments the views I have regarding the human brain and the most powerful computational models that human brains are able to conceptualize (i.e., a Turing Machine).
