Appologies to Dave Chapel, but this made me really laugh.  I try not to post political stuff here, but I can't resist providing a link to this far left progressive socialist that is admitting to being tricked into support Ron Paul.  It sounds like one day this guy woke up and realized that RP is a true, small government, pro-self reliance conservative.
