The  Computer Merit Badge: how I'd complete the requirements NOW;
Part 4

--

This is the fourth installment in an attempt to cover some of the
requirements  of  the  Boy  Scout's Computer Merit Badge, which I
feel are the most important. The first requirement was covered in
the  first  three  postings.  This  post will be the first one to
start to cover the second requirement, which is:

2. Do the following:
   a. Tell what a program is and how it is developed.
   b. Give three examples of programming languages and what types
      of programming they are used for.
   c. Describe a source program and an object program.

What is a program?

As  was discussed in the previous postings, a digital computer is
a Turing Machine (usually built using a von Neumann architecture)
that has the ability to mimic any valid Turing Machine. In other-
words, it is a Universal Turing Machine (UTM) -  well,  Universal
Linearly Bounded Automata, given the non-infinite amount of memo-
ry. And how does one make use of a UTM? They must provide for it,
a  description of the machine they wish for this UTM to mimic. In
general terms, a "program" is the description  of  the  "machine"
one  wishes to make the UTM mimic. So, when one writes a computer
program, they are describing a  special  purpose  "machine"  that
they  wish  the general purpose machine to emulate. This does not
mean that one must literally describe the "machine", but any pro-
gram  can be modelled abstractly as such a machine. Through writ-
ing a program, one describes this machine implicitly.

The machine that one may describe in the program  can  be  ridcu-
lously  simple  (i.e.,  it actually does nothing) or it can be as
computationally powerful as another UTM. In otherwords,  one  can
write a program that tells the digital computer how to pretent to
be another UTM. And there are many programs that do this  -  both
using the theoretical model of an actual Universal Turing Machine
(i.e., with input tapes, read heads, etc), as an emulator of  ac-
tual  digital electronic hardware (e.g., VirtualBox, Bochs, etc),
and anything in between.

Why go through the pains of describing what a program is in terms
of  the  abstract  models of computation that have been discussed
before? Because in these terms, the definition of  a  program  is
simple.  A program is a description (either implicit or explicit)
of the kind of machine you want your digital computer to emulate.
This  is  only  the beginning of the answer to question of what a
program.

The next question should be, how does  one  describe  for  a  UTM
(i.e., your digital computer) what kind of machine it should emu-
late? The answer, in most common terms, is to write the  descrip-
tion using a programming language.  So, a programming language is
a way of describing for  a  digital  computer,  what  machine  it
should emulate. The machine, as noted above, can be described ei-
ther implicitly or explicitly. Implicit descriptions of this  ma-
chine  are  done through traditional programming languages. It is
possible to explicitly describe a Turing Machine. An  example  of
such  a description, complete with a Turing Machine simulator im-
plemented in JavaScript can be seen at:

<a href=http://www.secchat.de/tour2/>Turing Machine Simulator</a> (secchat.de)

From this point forward, any mention of a program will  refer  to
the  implicit  description  done  with an traditional programming
programming language. Creating literal and explicit  machine  de-
scriptions  and  running  a  simulator  can  be  fun  (and  prof-
itable...jk;), but it's not a practical way to write  a  program.
I  am  also not going into the interesting and storied history of
programming languages, but Wikipedia has a plethera  of  informa-
tion  about  it.  Programming  language research is to this day a
very active area of research, and there are  today  a  tremendous
number  of programming languages and programming paradigms (i.e.,
models of thought). Here's a link to get one started:

<a href=http://acm.lsu.edu/wiki/Programming_Languages>Information about Programming Languages, LSU@ACM</a> (acm.lsu.edu)

I also make my Firefox bookmarks publicly available. They contain
all sorts of links, mostly divided up by language:

<a href=http://share.xmarks.com/folder/bookmarks/JVB1K4n8vD>My Programming Language Bookmarks</a>

So,  if  one  wishes to describe to a computer what it should do,
they should write a program. The program can be written  in  many
different  ways, but the easiest way is to use a programming lan-
guage. As mentioned above, the number and  types  of  programming
languages  are  many.  So, for now, this will not be discussed. A
fairly comprehensive discussion about programming languages  will
follow  soon.  The  most important thing now is to know that pro-
grams tell computers what do and that these programs are  written
using programming languages.

How are progams developed?

The short answer is, using the following "development cycle":

1.  write  program using a (pure) text editor (vi,gvim,emacs,ned-
it,ultraedit,notepad,etc)

2. for compiled** languages (e.g.,  C,  Java,  etc),  compile  it
without warnings or errors (i.e., compile time errors)

3.  execute  the program to make sure it does what it is supposed
to (i.e., that it is "correct")

** Note - scripting lanaguages such as Perl or Python do not  re-
quire a "compilation" step; more about programming and the devel-
opment process will be discussed in detail in later posts.

Now, he real answer is long and twisted; this is not a good ques-
tion  and could apply to many aspects of program development. De-
veloping (or "writing") programs is so wrought with  peril,  that
many  consider  it to be a "art". There are countless attempts to
turn this "art" into an "engineering'  discipline  (ala  Software
Engineering).  But, at the end of the day, the act of programming
is a creative process. The programmer is  first  an  artist,  and
second  an  engineer. The programming language and computer plat-
form that one chooses for development is analagous to  a  painter
choosing his canvas, paints, and brushes.

The  simple  fact  is  that very few programmers know exactly how
their program will look, function, and be  implemented  ahead  of
time.  The  development  process  is  therefore something that is
learned over time. Each programmer does things a  little  differ-
ently; and this fact should be embraced and cause both excitement
and reassurance that if you enjoy programming, it is very much  a
personal  process  of  learning  and  creating.  Lessons  will be
learned, techniques will be mastered, but  ultimately  each  pro-
grammer will do things a little differently - and for vastly dif-
ferent reasons. This applies to the  language  they  prefer,  the
paradigm  in  which  they  think  more clearly (e.g., imperitive,
functional, object oriented, etc).

A Final Note - Programs vs. Algorithms

Often, people will interchange the  terms  "program"  and  "algo-
rithm".  This  is  unfortunate, so I will attempt to describe the
difference. An algorithm is a set of steps  for  accomplishing  a
certain  objective. A program can implement a single algorithm. A
program can also contain  many  different  algorithm  implementa-
tions,  which  are  meant to provide various program features.  I
will talk about algorithms in future  posts,  but  for  now  I'll
leave you with the following.

An  algorithm is meant to determine a certain thing. For example,
there are many algorithms (some not so efficient) for finding the
shortest  paths  between  two cities on a map given many possible
paths (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm). An algorithm also exists out-
side  the  realm  of an implementation. It's the list of steps to
follow, and may be described  either  formally  (in  mathematical
terms or psuedocode) or informally (say, in plain English).

Programs are fully featured tools that may use the implementation
of many different algorithms (using a  programming  language)  to
provide  various  features  - for example, Microsoft Word. In the
case when a program executes one and only one algorithm, the dif-
ference between the program and the algorithm is that the program
*implements* the algorithm. Without the  program  implementation,
the  algorithm still exists. However, without the implementation,
the program can't exist. Confused? :)

The following links go to Wikipedia's  pages  for  more  detailed
definitions of algorithms and programs, respectively:

<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm>Algorithms</a> (wikipedia.com)
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program>Computer Program</a> (wikipedia.com)

Summary

To conclude this post, the most important point is that a program
is a set of instructions for the computer to follow. More  impor-
tantly,  these  sets of instructions are not meant simply for the
computer to follow. They are meant to be a description of a  com-
putational  machine  that  the  programmer wishes for the digital
computer to emulate. Recall the focus  on  Universal  Turing  Ma-
chines  -  machines that are able to emulate any other valid type
of machine, including other UTMs! A programming language is  what
the  programmer  uses  to  describe the machine to be emulated or
mimicked, by the UTM.  The practice of "writing" or developing  a
program includes with it a tremendous amount of approaches, meth-
ods, and opinions. There are as  many  programming  languages  as
there  are  programmers willing to create another way to describe
their machines, following their own preferences.  Programming  is
therefore  a  very  creative  and person endeavor. One who sticks
with programming will soon develop a preferenced for the  differ-
ent  tools  and  approaches  they  come to discover. Chosing such
things as architecture, platform, and languages to use is similar
to the process an artists goes through when arriving to his pref-
erences of his canvas, paint, and paint brushes.

In the following postings, I will use the remaining two  require-
ments  to  discuss in more detail: programming languages and what
it means to "compile" a program into something that the  computer
can "execute".

Cheers,
