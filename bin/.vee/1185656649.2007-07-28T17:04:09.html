Good article on GAs

--

This  article  as  New Scientist caught my eye because if gives a
pretty good overview of evolutionary algorithms applied to  prob-
lems of design. Their premise, that GA's are surpassing the abil-
ities of human designers is not new nor is it  noteworthy  in  my
opinion.  GA's  do not exhibit intelligence, but they do allow an
efficient way to search a very large search space of viable  com-
binations of properties.

<a href="http://xrl.us/3jy8"> http://xrl.us/3jy8 </a>

From  my  point of view, the most difficult part of writing a ge-
netic algorithm is determining how  to  formulate  what  you  are
evolving.   In the article, they talk about designing things like
ship hulls.  In engineering design, there is often a balance  be-
tween like the amount of material, stength, flexibility, etc.  In
otherwords, the algorithms try combinations and  designs  that  a
human  engineer  never would.  In doing so, it is not unusual for
superior designs to be found.  It is even more common that  these
designs are like nothing a person would have tried.

Now, when I say formulate the problem, I am not talking about the
fitness function - the thing that tests if an individual is "fit"
enough  to  be  mated  with another fit individual.  I am talking
about deciding what parts are the "genes" - or in otherwords, how
are the pieces and parts that are changed designed?

One interesting aspect of this for me would be to apply it to al-
gorithm design.  My problem here is, how do you break up an algo-
rithm?  It seems to me that on some level you have to design some
constituent parts that fit together - like Lego  blocks.   It  is
these blocks that are then put together by the GA, tested for fa-
vorable characteristics.  The combinations of these  characteris-
tics are then propagated through the evolutionary process.

Here  is a thought exercise: how do you evolved a code?  It seems
that you can't simply use the syntax of the language as the genes
-  it  would be impressive just to get a piece of code that could
compile.  So, you have to have chunks of code that you  know  are
valid  already  - chunks that could then be placed into some sort
of predefined template.  After thinking about this for  sometime,
it  seems  like  you'd  have  to design your process to the point
where you are really just selecting the combination of a  certain
set  of  routines  that  you know, when put together, do what you
want them to.

Maybe one day I'll sit down and write a program that  evolves  an
"algorithm,"  but  for  now  it seems to me that applications for
GA's requires the problem to be broken up into pieces  for  which
the  evolutions  simply the combinations of routines.  Is there a
way to evolve chuncks of code in  an  interleaving  fashion  such
that  you  can  control  what  they  do such that you have a good
chance of having "individuals" that pass your fitness function?
