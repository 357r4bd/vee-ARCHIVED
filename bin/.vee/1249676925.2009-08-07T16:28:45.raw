polyglot programming

--

Thanks to wikipedia, I was just introduced to polyglot programming; i.e., having a single "program" be valid in multiple languages, potentially doing very different things.

The original artical: 

'nf
  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_(computing)>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_(computing)</a>
'fi

The external links at the end of the WP artical has links to a few interesting texts, e.g., a 15 language polyglot program. Don't ask me what it does!

Enjoy!
