- put sort commands into variables at the top of the code so that those experiencing issues with :number being deprecated can make it stop complaing by doing the right thing

- look at groff errors - seems to be eluding me, but over all it is mainly an annoyance

- tested some more, please report any bugs

Added handling for groff-utf8, but need to test.
