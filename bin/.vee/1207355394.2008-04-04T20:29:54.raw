What I learned this week, 2

--

This week has flown by.  Without further ado:

'nf
<ul>
  <li>People are actually using, customizing, and liking vee;
  <li>How to set up anonymous ftp on a FreeBSD server;
  <li>Interesting things about Eularian and Hamiltonian paths and cycles;
  <li>How Kruskal's MST and Dijkstra's Shortest Path *really* work;
  <li>That I like graph theory and graph problems a lot;
  <li>A little about Haskell;
  <li>A little about how Lambda Calculus works and how to read that crazy Lambda notation;
  <li>And of course, that I really don't know squat;
</ul>

'fi
