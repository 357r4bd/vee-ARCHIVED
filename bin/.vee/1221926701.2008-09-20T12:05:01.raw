[vee] FreeBSD Port Update

--

I noticed that vee in the FreeBSD ports tree was an old version, and that lead me to discover that it no longer had a maintainer.

I am happy to report that I made an attempt to update vee via the official FreeBSD ports process, and I've also volunteered to become the port maintainer.

The process was fun (for me :), and I hope that they let me be the official maintainer - I don't see why they wouldn't.  I found the FreeBSD ports team to be exceptionally friendly and helpful.

Could this pave the way for me to get more involved with FreeBSD?  I sure hope so - one day I might graduate to some more substantial roles; being a port maintainer of an insignificant port really only gives one a single direction to go - up.

I have not heard from anyone regarding vee in sometime - that's okay because it either means that there are no problems or no users...except me; and I am just fine by that.

Cheers
