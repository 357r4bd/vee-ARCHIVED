Distributed Finite State Machines Using MPI

--

While I never got around to playing with Erlang this summer, I did find some time to play around with creating distributed finite state machines using MPI.

These basic examples can be expanded into creating real distributed simulators for distributed algorithms, systems, and protocols.  It is simply meant for proof of concept and I still very much want to become familiar with Erlang.
