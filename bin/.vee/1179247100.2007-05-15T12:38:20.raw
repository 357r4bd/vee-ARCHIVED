2,3 Turing Machine Research Prize

--

I decided to read the Wolfram newsletter that I normally get but delete - and I am glad I did read it.  In addition to celebrating NKS' 5th birthday, Wolfram announced a $25,000 prize for proving or disproving the universality of what could be the smallest known Turing machine.

I spent several hours lastnight looking at it, figuring out how the machine worked, etc.  I am no expert, but I know enough to play around with it.  Maybe this will be my summer project :).

There are many approaches to showing the universality of these sorts of systems, but the most common is emulating a system that has already been shown to be universal such as Conway's Game of Life.

I read NKS a couple of years ago, and while I am no silly fanboy I do have a lot of positive things to say about the book and the role it played in introducing me to many concepts that I appreciate now more than ever.

Here's to working on the problem!  I doubt I'll solve it, but simply trying will be very good experience.

Cheers.
