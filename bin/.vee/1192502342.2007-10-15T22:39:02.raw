My favorite quote can apply to life, not just compilers:

<i>OM: Like in any environment, monopolies are bad. They create dependency. Dependency means you cannot decide completely by yourself on the route to take, because choices are lacking. Removing all dependencies may be a utopia, but it does not hurt to strive to be self-supporting.</i>

There is also a link that talks about why GCC isn't the best:
