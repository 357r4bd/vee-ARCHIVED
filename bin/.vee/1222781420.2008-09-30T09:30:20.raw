strangly enough, I agree...

Strangely enough, I agree with Richard Stallman's take on this so called 'cloud computing' thing; which in reality is simply the commercially backed version of the FAILED vision of grid computing (my opinion, not RMS').

I need to do some more reading on this growing opposition because in TFA linked above, Larry Ellison of Oracle, and by all accounts on the opposite political and economic philosphyfrom Stallman says that:

"The interesting thing about cloud computing is that we've redefined cloud computing to include everything that we already do," he said. "The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women's fashion. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I have no idea what anyone is talking about. What is it? It's complete gibberish. It's insane. When is this idiocy going to stop?"

Ellison's comments can be found in the link below:
