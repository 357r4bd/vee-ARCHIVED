artifical life

--

There is a big buzz about the creation of artificial biological life, which is in fact an attempt to copy some of the most basic forms of biological life.

This is neat and all, but I think it is becoming obvious that the mechanisms that facilitate the functionality required for "life" need not be biological in nature.  It has been well know for a long time that there are some basic functions that need to be available have a "living" system: membrane/boundaries, the ability to reproduce, and the need to consume energy.

I am not suggesting /intelligent/ life, but merely the ability for discrete "bundles" of energy converting units (i.e., biological organisms, plasma blobs, etc) to "live", "die", and "reproduce".

The article I posted a few back outlines the discovery of some interesting dynamics in the universe that outlines some inorganic, interstellar dust clouds that interact in "lifelike" ways.  I don't doubt this, and more importantly it hints that the mechanisms which drive life are not limited by scale.  I am not saying that our universe is sitting under the finger of some giant being, but it is interesting to consider that the same distributed interactions that allow us to live may be available on a limitless scale.
