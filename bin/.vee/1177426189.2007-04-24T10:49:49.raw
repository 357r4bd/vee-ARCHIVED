please don't appeal to my fear or think I might care..

This page finally made me realize why global warming chicken littles bother me so much:

What I want to know is, when are environmentalists going to realize that the way to convince people to use alternative "clean" energies is to appeal to our desire to have CHEAPER, more independent sources of energy? When I say "independent" I mean a way to generate electricity MYSELF.  I don't mean it in terms of the US not relying on oil from unstable countries - I mean me not relying on the national electrical grid.  

If a technology came out that allowed me to make a relatively small investment, break ties with the bastard power and natural gas companies, and not rely on a relatively unreliable distribution mechanism (i.e., power lines from a centeral source) then I would jump on that in a second.

What is needed is a disruptive technological break through - like super cheap, efficient, and super long lasting solar panels that would allow me to disconnect from the grid completely.  The key is that I would have to be able to recover any modest investments very quickly - and for me that is no longer than 3-6 months.  It would additionally have to be very low to no maintenance and super easy to install so that I don't have to pay a licensed electrician to do it.         

Why would I want to pay a premium on a hybrid car? To "save the planet"?  Don' make me LOL out loud there.  The same goes for the expensive, fragile, and low yield indepenent energy sources that are available today.

These people need to spend less time talking and more on facilitating the disruptive technological breakthroughs that will allow everyone to finally become energy independent.  I can see a time when each house generates its own electricity.  No power lines mean no power outages during severe weather.  They'd be more money in the pockets of everyone, so other industries would grow to accomidate the loss of the energy markets, etc.  It is a win for the real world, practical consumer and for the enviro-freak.

I don't see this as a conspiracy of any particular industry trying to preserve its dominance.  I see it as a failure of the tree hugger, socialist freaks from understanding the power of the free market to effect change.  If the supposed concern for the Earth's environment was not a passive attack against Capitalism, I might be more inclined to agree with the message.  At the end of the day, the choice to not take the free market approach is a very conscious, calculated, and utterly retarded one - from what I can tell, anyway.
