Backus vs Dijkstra

I am reading John Backus Turing Award speech from 1977, which currently seems to be a lamenting of imperative (von Neuman) style programming languages.

To which, EJD provides a response (which I have not read yet).

I am reading them both and will provide some thoughts of my own.

There is some brief discussion about it at:

update: I forgot to mention where I actually first noticed the Backus speech:
