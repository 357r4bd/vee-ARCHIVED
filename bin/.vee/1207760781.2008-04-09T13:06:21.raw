computer science sans computer

--

The Computer Science pioneer, Edsger W. Dijkstra, once said that, "Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."  While this is just one of the many truths he spoke, many people unfortunately do not believe this.  Even if they told you they did, they certainly don't practice this type of mentality.

I stumbled upon a great website dedicated to teach computer science "unplugged;" i.e, without a computer.
