[vee] now available for use at FreeShell.org

--

The good folks over at FreeShell.org have installed vee (via NetBSD's pkgsrc) onto iceland.freeshell.org, for members who wish to use it for a minimalistic blogging experience.

'nf
  <a href=http://sdf.lonestar.org/index.cgi?telnet>Join FreeShell.org</a>
'fi

Note that in order to get the webspace, one must validate their account, but it is easy and well worth it.

Once the account is validated, one simply needs to login to iceland.freeshell.org to get their web space set up.

'fi

Notes:

'nf
* also put into your ~/.profile, 'umask 022', otherwise each time
  vee is used, you'll have to rerun 'mkhomepg -p' in your $HOME so
  that the permissions get set right again
'fi

I have set up my user page on Freeshell with a vee blog - though it is
really just full of test posts :)

Enjoy, and thanks again, SDF!

Cheers..
