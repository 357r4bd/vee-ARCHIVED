what I learned /last/ week :)

--

Last week was crazy, so I didn't post.  I can't think of too much other than:

'nf
<ul>
  <li>How to integrate google apps into a domain;
  <li>Who John Bently is; 
  <li>Newegg.com rocks;
  <li>A little bit about Standard ML;
  <li>More cool graph stuff;
  <li>That it is scary trusting a big dirt levee to keep me dry from the Mighty Mississippi!
  <li>That I have a lot of stuff to learn about *everything*;
</ul>

'fi
