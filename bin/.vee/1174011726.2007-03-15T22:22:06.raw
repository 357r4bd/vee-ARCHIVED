FreeBSD weirdness linked to bad memory

--

2 days ago, I started experiencing some really weird issues with my FreeBSD 6.2 headless bounce box.  First, /bin/sh, my shell began not respecting the previous histories.  When I pressed the "up" arrow, the text would appear, but the cursor would act like nothing was there.  Then, I found that I could not get X to forward anything to me.  The final two bits had fetchmail AND openssl segfaulting.

I tried to reinstall, but that didn't work.  It was then that it was suggested to me to run memtest on the memory.  Sure enough, there was a bad stick of memory.  After replacing the bad stuff with some that was lying around the office, it was good to go.

I then set FreeBSD back up.  I was actually very happy about starting over again.  I guess this thought deserves a post all by itself, but I find FreeBSD a joy to install and set up.  I don't demand too much, so maybe my opinion doesn't count.  Because I don't demand too much above what a minimal FreeBSD box gives
me, it was pretty quit to get the following things installed:

- screen

- mutt

- sudo

- fetchmail

Once I had fetchmail and mutt installed, I simply scp'd my .fetchmailrc, .muttrc. and my mbox back up over to my fresh install, and bam!  I was going all ahead full!  This got me thinking about what people should really want out of their OS.  To me, it is one of the most convenient things in the world to know that I can reinstall FreeBSD in under 5 minutes, get it how I like it in another 10, download my files, and trudge ahead like I didn't skip a beat.

Too many people, I find, treat their computer like some sort of ancestorial family home that they are supposed to keep around, nurture, and base their whole lives around.  The only problem is that if the hardware craps out or if they get some sort of virus, they are screwed.  I think it is much more mind easing to know that your data is backed up somewhere and that you can quickly and easily recreated an usable environment in under
an hour.

Forget spending days to save your data off of a corrupt Windows installation or cry when your favorite Linux box dies.  I say treat your computer like it is a hostile on your backpacking tip across Europe, not like the family manor that is supposted to be the center of your world.

Treat it as a tool to use and work your data (email, pics, docs, etc), but for heaven's sake know how to recreate your environment with minimal effort.  That said, know how to back up your data - use the bajillion options you have these days for saving your data remotely.  Data warehousing, simple and cheap hosting plans with gobs of disk space, etc.  Learn subversion, scp, rysnc, etc.  I can imagine going back to the world of windows where your life can get turned upside down by treating your machine as a black box that also happens to store all of your most valuable electronic data.  A lot of *nix users are guilty of this, too.

At the end of the day, I am just glad that I know that a bad stick of memory or a bad OS installation is not that big of a deal.  I also welcome excuses to recreate a fresh FreeBSD, minimal install - it is perhaps one of the nices environments that I know of in which to work.

Cheers
