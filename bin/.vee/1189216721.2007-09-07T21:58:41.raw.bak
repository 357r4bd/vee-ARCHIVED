Windows under qemu

--

For a recent class, I had to install a particular package that was vastly easier to use under Windows than my Xubuntu laptop.  I decide to give the x86 emulator, Qemu, a test drive.  So far, so good; in fact, it has given me a nice opportunity to play around with a Windows "installation" without fear of breaking it. I have gotten the virtual install down to a minimal set of services and other junk running.  It barely uses any resources while at rest - and for Windows, this is a huge accomplishment.

This got me thinking about an idea I had a long time ago.  I know it is not going to be the first time anyone suggested this, but it would be really helpful for Windows to provide a "sandbox" - or virtual Windows environment for users to "junk up" with all sorts are gnarley apps instead of screwing up their primary windows install.

Apprently, Qemu has a version that will run with Windows as the host application.  If this thing works, then theoretically all any one would have to do is:

1. Install a fresh version of Windows; this will be the "pure as a new fallen snow" installation - although it would be worth it to eventually minimizing the processes you need running.  Do not install anything other than Qemu here.

2. Install Qemu.  

3. Create a Qemu image and "install Windows" on it - Once the image is created, you should create multiple copies of it - so that you don't have to recreate any if you screw something up. 

At this point, you treat the virtual windows as another program. Install all the garbage you want, surf all the nasty sites with unpatched IE, etc.  If you screw something up and "Windows" crashes, then you can either kill it like any other program  - or delete the image and start fresh with one of your back ups.

From my experience, Qemu emulation is fast enough for stuff like web surfing, email checking, and work processing.  It is no good fo stuff like watching movies or playing games.

I may start a page that outlines how to totally minimize one's Windows installation.  For the time being, I have "sold out" and started a page called windowsrescuedisk.com where I try to give some good advice about rescuing a Windows install. When I say "sold out" I mean it is surrounded by Google adds - but I am going to be giving real advice on there that hopefully my grandmother in Kansas will be able to use.

I may as well use my Windows-on-Linux platform to experiment and figure out how to totally scale down Windows. And I can use my Google-experiment site to get the knowledge out there.  I did accidentally discover that Windows will still run with out explore.exe running a while back - I have an entry on this.
