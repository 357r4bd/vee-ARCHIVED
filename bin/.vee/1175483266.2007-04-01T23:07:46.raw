[vee] 0.9.8-delta is available

--

I changed a couple of things here:

1) superficially, I added a "powered by vee" footer to the index and to each entry.  This can be easily removed if you don't like it, but I appreciate the advertising.

2) more importantly, I've added the capability for "top" and "bottom" templates to be used for each entry; I use it here, in fact.  Details:

When an entry is echoed out, vee looks for two files in the current directory:

vee-top.tpl defines the top html
vee-bottom.tpl defines the bottom html

If these files are not found, then the original behavior ensues.  For right now, these files are fixed.  I will most likely use variables in future releases and I will also make it so it respects the -d option.  Right now it does not...you have to be in actual vee directory for it to be detected.

Enjoy.
