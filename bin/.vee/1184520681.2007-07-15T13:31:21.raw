[vee] update page...

--

I updated the vee project page with links to the Googlecode repository and a word on an inability to specify lines that I wish to not break.

For the line break issue, I think I might incorporate some simple "#nb" line prefix.  The idea would be to :

1. grep out all "#nb" lines, and replace them in stream with some incrementing value - like #1, #2, etc.

2. run the required formatting

3. run a search and replace over the newly formatted text, replacing "#n" with the text following the respective "#nb". 

I am pretty certain that this would allow me to specify line for which I wish to preserve as unbroken.
