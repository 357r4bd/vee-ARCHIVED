[vee] neat, people are using vee :)

--

From time to time, I use google to search for stuff like "Powered by vee" or "My vee index" to see if I can find users.  There are not many, but there are more than there were a month ago - which is to say around 4 or 5 :).  Very modest, but it is cool that people find this as useful and cool as I do.  

It is super easy to customize vee, so I would not be surprised if there are others out there that are not locatable.  If anyone wants me to add their blog to the roll I will - the usual caveats applie regarding the legality of the content.

I'll be squaring away the new filter feature in the next couple of days.  After that, I hope to write up some basic guides for "advanced" usage.  I will never abandon my goal of vee " working out of the box with zero configuration," but I am always looking for ways to make it easy for users to customize it to their liking.  

Offering a pre-formatting filter is the first step towards this goal.  Next is going to be looking at external utilities I can create (or accept from others) to help manage posts.
