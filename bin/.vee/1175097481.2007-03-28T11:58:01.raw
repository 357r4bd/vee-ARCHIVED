google adds

--

If you are a regular visitor, you'll notice that I added some Google Adds.  This is in an attempt to cash in on the vast popularity of my site (yeah right!).  Anyway, I will start adding real content, mostly geared on how to do something.  I might even throw in a product review or opinion piece outthere.  I am going to be staying out of the political opinion fray, of that you can be assured.

Peace
