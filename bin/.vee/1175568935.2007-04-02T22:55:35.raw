[vee] 0.9.8-epsilon is out

--

Variables now define the template:

TOP_TPL

BOT_TPL

Option can now determine these at the commandline:

-T top-template.tpl

-B bottom-template.tpl

When the files are specified while using "-d" to define the publishing directory, be sure to specify your template with respect to the directory specified with "-d".

At the moment, the template feature only works with the default formatting option, "groff".  I am going to reorganize things so that this can be abstracted out of the main formatting specifications.

Enjoy.
