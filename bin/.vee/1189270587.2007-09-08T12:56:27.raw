[vee] themes, mods, and utilities

--

I started a page to track user contributed modifications, utilities, and themes. It is in anticipation of the flood of users coming after the Freshmeat announcement (yeah right!!) :).

Utilities

Tools that aid in post management, etc.  The purpose and scope of these tools fall outside of what vee's intent is - a simple, easy to use blog entry tool.

Modifications:

I don't see a lot of options here, but it encompasses user-modified versions of vee that provide functionality that is within the scope of vee, but is not something that I want to include in core.  Options include: spell checking, special formatting (latex -> pdf, etc), etc.

Themes:

This would essentially be bundles of top and bottom templates along with associated files.

Cheers.
