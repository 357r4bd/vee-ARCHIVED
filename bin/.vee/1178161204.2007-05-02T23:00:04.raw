vee 0.9.9-beta out

--

This version includes some minor tweaks by efbeha, which represents the first outside 'patch' that I have accepted.  The change fixes the issue of "fold" breaking words and reliminates the many lines of blank lines that 'groff' adds.

I am tossing around the following tweaks for future releases:
1) flag to specify file extension for entries
2) ability to define template for index page; this may not be necessary, but I will make that call later

As always, please enjoy and be sure to let me know of any issues or ideas that you may have.

Cheers
