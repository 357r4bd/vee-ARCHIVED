[vee] 0.9.8-gamma (repost)

--

The most notable changes include the following features:

-r reformats just the latest message

-R reformats ALL messages

So,  the  old idiom of "vee -lr" will only reformat the last mes-
sage that was just edited.  Using "vee -lR" will let you edit the
last message AND then reformats ALL messages.

I  have been thinking about implementing a feature to edit a mes-
sage N messages before the last, but I am  not  sure  how  useful
that  is.   I  know  that being able to modify something you just
posted is a common need (for me, anyway),  but  I  don't  usually
need to go back and change things in my posts.  If I really need-
ed to, I can just manually do it then run "vee -r".  Then  again,
it might be something neat to have.  I don't know.

As  far  as  major things I'd like to work on, most of it is cen-
tered around making sure that all of  the  features  work  right.
One thing that has been bugging me lately is that hyperlinks tend
to break when using one of the formatting features.  I should try
to find a fix for this because it is pretty annoying.
