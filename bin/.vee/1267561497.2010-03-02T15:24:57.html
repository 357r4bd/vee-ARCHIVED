Backus vs Dijkstra - redux

--

In response my previous post:

<a href=/.vee/1265918013.2010-02-11T14:53:33.html>Backus vs Dijkstra</a>

I shall say only a few comments, otherwise I might go into an un-
informed rant about functional programming (i.e., prematurely).

I suspect that Dijkstra was not as smitten with  functional  lan-
guages  and programming as Backus was towards the end of his days
[1]. But, [2] was mostly a critique of the speech itself.  Howev-
er,  it  did  occur to me that Dijkstra remained unconvinced that
[1] went far enough to extoll the virtues of functional  program-
ming  versus  the  supposedly  "inelegant" contructs that the von
Neuman architecture imposes onto language design. I remain  simi-
larly  unconvinced that von Neumann architectures were inherently
bad, inferior to architectures that are supposed to make  FP  im-
plementations  more  efficient,  or that the "von Neumann bottle-
neck" was terrible thing [1] made it out to be.

[1] was given in the late 70's, and today  in  2010  von  Neumann
style programming is still alive and well. Functional programming
constructs have certainly made their  way  into  imperative  lan-
guages,  and mostly where they make sense.  While reading [1] (as
well  as  while  reading  rants   from   functional   programming
"purists"), I remained unconvinced of two things.

Firstly,  functional programming is neat and nice looking, but in
a mathematical way. I get what FP is and why it might seem pretty
and  neat.  I understand why its benefits are good things. What I
don't get is, what's so bad with imperative programming - or as I
like to see it, practical programming.

Secondly,  if  imperative  languages  are starting to incorporate
some of the more practical and useful features borrowed  from  FP
(hence,  making  them more like hybrid imperative/functional lan-
guages), why are some people so hell bent on pure functional pro-
gramming?  Sure, there are examples of very nice and simple solu-
tions that make imperative examples  look  as  if  cavemen  wrote
them;  but there are a great many practical things that break the
purely functional model of programming.

I am not against FP - it provides a nice view of programming; but
I can't see how it taken to its logical conclusions offers a bet-
ter solution than a hybrid language. The future of  languages  is
going  to  be based on augmenting imperative languages with those
features borrowed from FP that produce  a  significant  practical
benefit.

In  conclusion,  I  was a bit turned off by [1]; and clearly it's
been taken up by people who dream of a purely FP utopia.  They're
in  the  great minority, and to be frank, they annoy the crap out
of me. I'm attempting this exercise myself, but I'd be interested
in  seein  an example of how one might take a recipe for baking a
cake (i.e., an imperative form) and  put  it  into  a  functional
form.  Maybe  the  result  will  be very clear and concise, but I
doubt it - perhaps one can publish a book of recipes in function-
al  form  and  see how many house wives and grandmothers flock to
it. A Better Holmes classic it will not be. I am going  to  think
more  about  this  issue of the von Neumann bottleneck. Sure, [1]
paints a pretty ugly picture of it, but I don't think its an  ob-
stacle more than just the nature of how a human being might prac-
tically implement random access to memory.
