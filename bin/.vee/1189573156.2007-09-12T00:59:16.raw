[vee] summary of new features

--

1) Filters

Filters take in the raw text, perform some actions (not necessarily on the text) and spit out what should be taken as the raw text when finished.  It is this that is then formatted. 

* The default filter is "./vee-pre" and it should be placed in the publish directory.

* To specify a custom filter, use the "-x /path/to/filter" argument.

* Filters must be executable.

* Two sample filters are in the newly included "sample-filters/" directory: vee-pre and vee-filter.pl.

2) Custom format funcs 

This feature is largely untested, but it doesn't seem to break traditional usage :).  Anyway, one would set the following variables directly in vee:

Default format function:

FORMAT_FUNC=format_with_groff

Set format dispatcher (new formats require editing default dispatcher or specifying a new one:

FORMAT_DISPATCHER=default_set_format_func

Define script where new format functions are defined; default is unset:

FORMAT_CUSTOM_DEFS=                         

Note: while it is very tempting separate all formatting functions into a different file, I am going to resist the urge for now.  I just think that making the default system require more than a single file violates my original goals.  Making this external file optional allows users to upgrade the core vee with out having to worry about their customizations getting blown away.
