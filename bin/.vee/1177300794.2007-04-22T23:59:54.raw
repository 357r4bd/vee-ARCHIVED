House Article

This is what I transcribed form the hard to read copy of the article I
was given.  I am going to be getting in touch with the original
owner's son soon ( I hope ) to get the skinny on the more
history...sorry for any typos - I did this pretty fast.

IBERVILLE POSTMASTER REFLECTS

This week, the postal service may officially finalize closing the
Iberville Post Office and change the Zip Code of Residents from 70746
to 70776, according to postal officials in Baton Rouge.

Residents will receive mail from St. Gabriel, as they do now,
addressed to Iberville.

Actually the post office in the villiage of Iberville closed a year
ago, when the postmaster, Mrs. Louis G. Hoffman retired.  Her memories
continue to remain.

"When I first came out here," she said, "it was a little strange to
me, to be living in the country.  i was born and raised two blocks
from Third Street, and I never thought I would ever leave Baton Rouge
to go to the country.  But the odd part about that is, that I have two
sisters and one brother, and all of us, when we left Baton Rouge, we
went to live in the country.  My olders sister went to Hawaii.  She
lived there for forty-two years.  She's back in Louisiana now."

It was an abrupt awakening to become a postal employee.  When she got
married, her hustband had been running the post office but now had
begun to teach.

When I got married, and we were on honeymoon for two weeks, she says,
they came home-came here (to their house in Iberville), and "I said,
'Where are you going?' He said, 'I'm going to school, to teach'" "I
said, 'Well, what I am gonna do?' and he said, "Well, you're gonna
work in the post office, and the store. Surprise'" "I said, 'Well, I
have never sold anything before'".

Later, Mr. Hoffman was to become principle of St. Gabriel School and
then Super-intendent of Schools for Iberville Parish.  He retired a
number of years ago. And she got her first lesson on the job.  She had
been a nurse, had graduated from nursing school at the Lady of the
Lake Medical Center, and now she was the new postmaster.

It was really different to come out here and sell five yards of
material or a pair of [past-margin] (shoes?), or a pound of lard or a
pound of [past-margin], or a pind of rice.  Sometimes it (?) a nicle
of rice, or a nickle of beans because that is all they had to spend
for the day, she remembers.

She became the Postmaster in 1951, and retired on October 31 of last
year.  [off-margin] her was Joe Burns, who had asked the post office
to be established, since the residents of Manchac had to walk all the
way to St. Gabriel to get their mail.  Then came [off-margin] Hadell,
and the thrid postmaster was her husband.  But the mail service was
the only thing located in the small building her husband had build
next to the house.

We had a general merchandise stor, and we had the only telephone, she
says.  People would come day or night to use the phone.  They would
come to the Post Office for their mail.  I used to write their
letters, read their letters to them, and make their money orders -
they used Sears & Roebuck quite a bit.

"One of the most interesting things, when I first came out here, was
to ship hides, furs.  They'd bring them to the post office, and I'd
put them in sacks to package them and mail to them to St. Louis."

"Before I came out here they used to sell moss.  Moss was the big
product years ago.  They used to sell moss to Mr. Hoffman.  He'd ship
it."

Highway 30, or known as Nicholson Drive in Baton Rouge, provides
access for Ibervill residents today. At one time, though, there was
only a gravel road and residents had to go down the road to the river
road to take the seventeen mile stretch to Baton Rouge.  So mail was
not carried by truck.

"We had to go to the railroad track," she says, "and they would throw
our mail off in pouches. For them to get our mail, we had an iron arm
that we would attach the pouch to, and they would grab it (from the
train) as they passed."

"One day , we had a man that lived on the place that usually took the
mail, and after he had attached the mail pouch to this crane, a train
passed, loaded with .... [the rest is cut off of the page];
