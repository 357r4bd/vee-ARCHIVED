INTP Antilibrary

--

I decided to mine the brains of the INTP email list regarding some books that they found particularly satisfying, and I have started to compile this list at:

'nf
<a href=http://www.0x743.com/intp-antilibrary.htm>http://www.0x743.com/intp-antilibrary.htm</a>

'fi

If there are additional suggestions, please email me via the contact form:

I call it an "antilibrary" because it is supposed to represent knowledge and insights, to which one has not yet been exposed. Whereas a library is often the set of books one has read, and antilibrary is that set of books one has not read. I got this from Taleb's, "Black Swan" book.

Cheers,
