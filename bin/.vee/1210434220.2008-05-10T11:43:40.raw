the end of the semester has arrived

--

The end of Spring 2008 has finally arrived for me.  I learned a lot - both good and bad.

First the good.  I learned a lot about graph theory, and I can say that I enjoyed the class thoroughly.  I learned more about how to write proofs and that I am very interested in certain discrete mathematical topics.  In Fall I am taking a combinatorics class,  and I hope to eventually take an abstract algebra class or two.  

This summer, I am taking a selected reading class with a profession whom I wish to have as my advisor.  More on this in a future post.

Now the bad (beware, rant).

While I learned a lot in "programming languages," it was not enough to offset the horrible experience a terrible teacher can give someone who is there to learn.  I started off the semester looking forward to learning all about advanced programming language design.  This includes stuff like axiomatic, operational, and denotational semantics.  I did learn what they all were, but at a hefty emotional price.

I suppose one could blame the department for pulling in an PhD with ZERO teaching experience or personality, but at some point the teacher themself is to blame for providing the student with an ineffective learning environment.  The person that traditionally teaches this class was unavailable for some reason, but he is consistently rated as one of the best teachers in the department.  Unfortunately, the best got replaced with the worst.

I don't know if I would have dropped the class knowing then what I know now, but it chaps my ass royally that I had to be part of the class where a crappy newbie teacher used  us to test crazy/stupid teaching methods. Oh, and did I mention that the teacher knew absolute shit about the subject?  When one asks informed questions on the material being presented, they should expect the teacher should know enough to provide even a basic answer.  No.  You'd also expect them to at least know the material on the slides (that they jacked) well enough to effectively explain it and answer basic clarifying questions about it. No.

In summary, I believe that I, amongst others, got totally fucked. We were failed by both the department and by the teacher.  You can bet your ass that I am going to avoid this topic from now on, and this is a real shame because in the beginning I was interested in giving it a chance.
