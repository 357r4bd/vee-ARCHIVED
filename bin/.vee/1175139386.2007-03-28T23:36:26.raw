[vee] playing around with templates

--

Well, it happened.  I found a need to use templates. I guess it didn't take long for me to realize that I wanted to used this google adword thing that I should include the stuff on my posts.

I will not release the latest code until it is well tested, but here is what I am thinking:

1) one can defined a VII_TOP_TPL and VII_BOTTOM_TPL at the top

2) if VII_TOP_TPL is detected in the the present working directory, then this file is cat'd to ${FINAL}, otherwise the default html is used;

3) same goes for VII_BOTTOM_TPL

So, in a nutshell, it will allow vee to keep its zero configurationg credo while allowing someone to develop their own nifty template.  Granted, one will only be able to define the top and bottom sections of the html, but that still offers a lot of flexibility.

The other "con" is that all formatting functions must check for this and offer an alternate top/bottom html if either template is not found....yeah, think I like it.

Cheers.
