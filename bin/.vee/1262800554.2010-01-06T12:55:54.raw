Configuring CPAN from the CPAN prompt

--

I have been using Perl for eons now, and just realized that I don't have to manually edit CPAN/Config.pm to do things like add urls.

To add a fetch URL, for example:

'nf
  cpan[0]>o config urllist push "url_to_add"
'fi

Then commit the change:

'nf
  cpan[1]>o config commit
'fi

Done!

For good measure, the list of CPAN mirror sites:

'nf
<a href=http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html>CPAN Mirror Listing</a>
'fi

To view all configurable options, type:

'nf
  cpan[2]>o conf
'fi

Also, I recently installed BioPerl on a production system, and the instructions also provide some insights into a few useful features of CPAN - about which I was unaware.

'nf
<a href=http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Installing_Bioperl_for_Unix>CPAN instructions for BioPerl</a>
'fi

Enjoy!
