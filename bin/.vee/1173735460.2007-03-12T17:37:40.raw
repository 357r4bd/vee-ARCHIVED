a good stopping point

--

For the last week or so, I've focused my "computer nerd energies" on getting the vee thing to a good, usable point.  I think I am there.  I will continue to tweak as needed or as the useful feedback continues.  Now that is pretty much at a good break point, I shall return to my CS interests, which currently have to do with advanced computer networks and my Perl FLaT automata package.  Currently, I am investigating some ways to identify all cycles in a digraph by discovering all acyclic paths from x->y.  This will most likely be the in which I accomplish the generation of valid strings given a DFA with closures.  It is also an interesting way to get a little more into set theory, graph theory, and discrete math.  One thing is for sure, it is interesting stuff to me :).

Some questions I have include:

- how does one know when you've found all cycles?  There should be a finite number of acyclic segments that make up the cycles since there are a finite number of nodes

- how can one exploit the child parent relationship of related acyclic paths?

- how unique are these paths, and how many unique paths are part of the same cycle?

I know this stuff is out there somewhere - I am not smart enough to stumble upon new stuff, especially regarding graph theory.  The answer is out there, I am sure of it, but for the time being I don't know what it is.  

Cheers.
