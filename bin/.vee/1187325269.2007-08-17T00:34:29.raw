inorganic, interstellar "life"

--

The following article talks about plasma interacting in ways that would normally be observed in organic life forms.  The more stories I see involving molecular dynamics, the more I like that field.  I see a lot of similarities between it and the areas of computer science in which I am interested.

I really like the notion that local rules governing the interaction of many discrete particles give rise to complex emergent behaviors.  It seems to me that the field of molecular dynamics is one of the best places to see how discrete objects operating under local rules can give rise to complex and seemingly global phenomenon.  I've seen some pretty cool animations done using a program called NAMD that illustrated how some pretty "intelligent" behavior can arise out of a bunch of molecules interacting with one another.

I know it is not right to dismiss chemistry as the basis behind these "simple rules" of interaction, but I can't help but generalize past the actual mechanisms that give rise to the rules themselves.  That, and I don't know a lick about chemistry :).
