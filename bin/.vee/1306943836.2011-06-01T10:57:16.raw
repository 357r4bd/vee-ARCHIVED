new job

--

I have been working in the area of high performance computing for many years now - over 10.

In that time, I have met a lot of great people and learned a lot. I, however, feel completely 
burned out. I have only a couple of weeks left at my current job, but after I am done I will 
enumerate what about it has burned me out.

My new job will have me working in the medium I love - Perl. Hopefully I will love the job and
work, too. I think I will like it a lot, but only time will tell.
