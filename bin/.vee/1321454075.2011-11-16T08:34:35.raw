[vee] initial veels utility added

--

Since I am on a bet to add fundamental vee utilities, I have created the first real basic util
for vee - introducing, "veels", it is meant to be a general purpose listing utility for vee
.raw files.  

It's intended to replace the need for "ls" in most situations dealing with .raw files, and in situations
that it doesn't, there are fall back options to use the system ls ([-l][-L ls-opts]).o

I hope to add additional basic utilities in the near terms.

Enjoy!

<pre>
Basic usage:  %veels [-dr [-a] [[-l][-L "ls opts"]]]

GetOpts processing (first cut):

while getopts 'ad:hlL:r' option; do
    case "$option" in                                                                                                 
    a) SHOWALL=1 # show filename, date, and title of post
       ;;
    d) if [ -d "${OPTARG}" ]; then # choose another directory to check for .raw files                                 
         VEEDIR="${OPTARG}"
       else
         die_error "${OPTARG} is not a directory!"
       fi
       ;; 
    l) USELS=1 #use ls with default opts
       ;;
    L) USELS=1 #use ls with custom opts
       LSOPTS="${OPTARG}"
       ;;
    r) SORT=$SORT_OLD_FIRST  # list in reverse post order
       ;;
    h) usage # some help page
       die_cleanly
       ;;
    esac
done

'fi
