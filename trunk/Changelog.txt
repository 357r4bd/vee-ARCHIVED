- put sort commands into variables at the top of the code so that
  those experiencing issues with :number being deprecated can make
  it stop complaing by doing the right thing
- look at groff errors - seems to be eluding me, but over all it is
  mainly an annoyance
- tested some more, please report any bugs

Added handling for groff-utf8, but need to test.
