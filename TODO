1. create a "template" filter that will allow one to define a set of templates

a) basic template filter
b) more functional, advanced template filter using Perl's template toolkit, URL 
extraction/detection, and text formatting

2. abstract backend; default to classic file based .raw, but offer an advanced 
interface using a backend like SQLite; this is for raw content, and doesn't imply
a database driven site. Content is meant to be static.

3. develop some sample utilities (outside of ./vee) that allow for various post 
management tasks
