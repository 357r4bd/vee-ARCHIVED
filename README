vee is a zero-conf, command line microblogging tool that I created because I
hated having to set up web-based blogging software every so often.  It became
popular for some reason, and now it's used in some for by many people - mostly in
silence.  It does everything I want it to do, hence the lack of feature creep; 
however I am always interested in improving it in some basic way.

It's available in a variety of package repositories, like pkgsrc and FreeBSD Ports.

Enjoy it!
