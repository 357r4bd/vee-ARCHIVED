vee is a highly portable, zero configuration (but configurable), cli 
microblogging tool that I created because I hated having to set up 
web-based blogging software every so often. It became popular for some 
reason, and now it's used in some for by many people - mostly in silence. 
It does everything I want it to do, hence the lack of feature creep; 
however I am always interested in improving it in some basic way.

It's available in a variety of package repositories, like pkgsrc and
FreeBSD Ports.

vee is one of hundreds of "static site generators", many of which are
listed at https://staticsitegenerators.net.

Version: 

2.0-rc1
License:

vee is released under the WTFPL. See the LICENSE file for more information.

Portability Goals:

0. no external dependencies other than Bourne Shell and traditional 
   Unix userland tools (no need to install non-optional utils)
1. any *nix platform that supports Bourne Shell (sh)
2. it "just works" out of the box
3. new versions won't require "upgrading"

Incompatibilities:

The goal of vee is that it should work on minimal systems using only
original Bourne shell (sh) and without having to install anything. I
originally began this work on FreeBSD, but it seems that a couple of
utilities seem to not be the most portable in their usage. In particular,
`date` and `sort` have caused some headaches, but alas they have been
tamed.

Project Status:

Update - recently I have had some interest and time in addressing some
issues that have been plaguing MacOS (i.e., sort), all platforms (date),
and have a couple of goals to make vee easy to install locally to try out.
Also included is an attempt to understand the utf8 issues that have been
reported. My goal is to have a 1.0 release very soon.

This is one of those "forever" projects that met my needs very early
on, and I have revisited the code for only incremental improvements.
I'd like to get to 1.0, but this would realy just mean a nice set
of useful utilities (veels, veecat, vee-rebuild) and associated
documentation. Work towards this has been spotty, but progress has
been good. At some point, I'll have some time to wrap it up and
present version 1.0 - at which point it's likely I'll cease any work
on it other than bug fixes or applying patches from others.

                    is no maintaining of the order from newest first to last;

 user will be prompted for title and presented with vi

%vee -t "this is the title"                                                 
                                                                              
 user will just be presented with a vi session;                               
                                                                              
%cat text.txt | vee -b -t "my title" -m "text to go before stdin"         
                                                                              
 This publishes contents of text.txt with provided title; -m's msg will be    
 shown above the cat'd text. This means of publishing content is well suited  
 for use with cronjobs or batch processes. It also works when GopherMode! is  
 invoked (-g|-G).                                                             
                                                                              
%vee -l       # edit and reformat the latest post

%vee -n       # see which post is the 8th latest post                         
%vee -R       # reformats ALL posts that have *.raw files                     
                                                                              
To delete a post forever:                                                     
                                                                              
1) delete the entry in the INDEX                                              
                                                                              
2) purge the entry:                                                           
  %vee -p    # make sure it is the one you want to purge                      
  %vee -P    # purge it!                                                      
                                                                              
 brings up the latest entry as a vi sessions; when changes are save,          
 all messages are reformatted                                                 
                                                                              
              :E We Need to Talk About Gopher Support :E                      
                                                                              
vee supports the creation of content in the gophersphere by formatting text-only
posts using the provided formatters (meant for text-only anyway). vee also goes
a step further and generates the gophermap (index listing) for you.           
                                                                              
All of the vee commands immediately above *should* work when GopherMode! is on
which is as simple as adding the -g xor -G flags. -g invokes the Gopher bits  
*and* the default www support. -G only invokes the Gopher bits. Not using -g  
 or -G only involes the traditional www support.                              
                                                                              
Usage examples from above, with GopherMode! enabled:                          
                                                                              
%vee -l -G      # edit and reformat the latest post                           
%vee -L 5 -g    # allows one to edit and reformats the fifth latest post      
%vee -r 8 -G    # reformats the 8th latest post                               
%vee -n         # see which post is the 8th latest post                       
%vee -R -g      # reformats ALL posts that have *.raw files                   
                                                                              
Notes:                                                                        
                                                                              
0. Reminder - vee requires zero configurations to start, but *can* be coed    
   by creating a .veerc file. This is also the case when in GopherGeb!Mode    
                                                                              
1. Batch mode looks for piped input via STDIN; if none after a short time,    
   message creation fails UNLESS something was passed in via '-m' as well.    
   If nothing was passed in via '-t' for the title, some default is used;     
   This is set at the top of the script as 'DEFAULT_TITLE'.                   
                                                                              
2. Interactive mode (default) prompts for a title if no '-t' is provided.     
   Such is the case even if '-m' is used.  If '-m' is not used in this        
                                                                              
3. Gopher support (-g|-G) is limited and users may discover weird issues with 
   updating posts or the batch reformatting options. It's a best effort. Also 
   the gophermap is fully regenerated whenever a new post is added; for a large
   number of posts this may take a few seconds.                               
                                                                              
4. Patches are welcome; the goal is not more feature bloat, but a nicer       
   way of dealing with STDIN, etc and reports/fixes for any weird gopher phlog
   bugs or UX would be greatly welcomed. vee development laid dormant for years,
   being used as a niche static site generator. But the rediscovery of Gopher 
   by the masses has made adding Gopher support a high priority.
