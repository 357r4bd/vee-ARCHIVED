The tests in this directory output TAP, so the best way
to get some valid output is to use Perl's 'prove' program,
for example:

	$ prove .
	./000-dummy.t .. ok    
	All tests successful.
	Files=1, Tests=15,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.05 usr  0.02 sys +  0.48 cusr  1.16 csys =  1.72 CPU)
	Result: PASS

The 'prove' program comes with Perl, so it's not really in line with the goal
of vee to work on any base *nix system, but I don't want to 
get into the business of building my own TAP harness or carrying 
along 3rd party code.
