The tests in this directory output TAP, so the best way
to get some valid output is to use Perl's 'prove' program,
for example:

	# prove .
	./000-basic.t .. ok
	./001-sort.t ... ok
	All tests successful.
	Files=2, Tests=19,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.03 usr  0.01 sys +  0.26 cusr  0.21 csys =  0.51 CPU)
	Result: PASS

The 'prove' program comes with Perl, so it's not really in line 
with the goal of vee to work on any base *nix system, but I don't want to 
get into the business of building my own TAP harness or carrying along 
3rd party code.
