I am more than fine with anyone wishing to fork vee with the intention of creating 
a new tool that may never be incorporated back into vee.

There are only 2 requests that I have if you wish to do this:

1. conspicuously mention that vee provided the starting point for your tool
2. issue pull requests for backward compatible changes; these included but are limited to:
  a. whitespace, code formatting fixes
  b. syntax updates that make the code more robust, consistent, or cross-compatible
  
I am always happy to hear from anyone using vee as a tool or as the start of a new tool.
  
Thank you,
estrabd
